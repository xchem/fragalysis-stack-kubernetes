# A play that can be used to check Pods in a given cluster for
# read-only filesystem issues. The play uses a map of volumes
# and the Pods that use them. The play will attempt to write
# to the volume, reporting any that cannot be touched.
#
# You can use delete_failed_pods to also delete Pods that fail.
