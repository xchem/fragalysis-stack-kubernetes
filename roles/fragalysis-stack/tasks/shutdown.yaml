# Tasks required to 'shutdown' a deployed version of Fragalysis.
# Rather than a full delete, which would simply require the removal of the
# namespace, this play leaves the SSL certificate and (optionally)
# the database (normally no) and media (normally yes) volumes.
#
# Designed for use predominantly for the Production cluster's staging stack.
#
# This playbook first ensures that the Fragalysis namespace exists
# and that an existing deployment exists - the user is first supposed
# to have deployed the stack before shutting it down.

# If it looks like we're deploying to OpenShift
# we need to use the k8s authentication module to login
# and obtain an API key.

# A kubernetes (or OpenShift) host and an API key must be set.
# We will either have authenticated against an OpenShift server
# or the AWX kubernetes credentials will have injected suitable
# values for the K8S_AUTH_HOST and K8S_AUTH_API_KEY environment variables.
# Either way the ansible variables 'k8s_auth_host' and
# 'k8s_auth_api_key' will have been set.
